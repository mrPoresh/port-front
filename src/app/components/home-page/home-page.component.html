            <h5>I am a front-end developer and a student at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, majoring in Control Engineering and Robotics. I have been living in the city of Wroclaw for about 6 years, at the moment I work full-time as a front-end developer when my studies allow :) I like to create user-friendly and modern web applications, I mainly use Angular, in my opinion it is one of the best frameworks for the web, since the tools in it allow you to create applications of unlimited size and complexity. I also like the Astro framework because of its architecture.</h5>
